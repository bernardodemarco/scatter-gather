In parallel programming, synchronization and data sharing between threads are critical issues. Proper synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and barriers are essential to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency. These mechanisms allow threads to coordinate their activities and access shared resources safely, which is vital for the correctness of parallel programs.

Another important aspect of parallel programming is load balancing, which ensures that all processors are utilized efficiently. Dynamic load balancing techniques can redistribute tasks among processors to avoid scenarios where some processors are idle while others are overloaded. This helps in achieving optimal performance and efficient resource utilization in parallel computing environments.
