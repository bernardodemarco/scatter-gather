Distributed programming involves the creation of software systems that run on multiple computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. These systems are designed to share resources and data processing tasks across a network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of applications. Distributed programming is fundamental to the operation of large-scale web services, cloud computing, and enterprise-level applications.

One of the key challenges in distributed programming is ensuring consistency and fault tolerance across multiple nodes. Techniques such as distributed databases, consensus algorithms, and replication are used to manage data consistency and availability. Distributed systems must also handle network latency and potential failures gracefully, making robust error handling and recovery mechanisms crucial components of these systems.
