Parallel programming is a computing paradigm that enables the execution of multiple processes simultaneously. By dividing large problems into smaller tasks, parallel programming can leverage multiple processors to solve these tasks concurrently. This approach significantly reduces the time required for computation and enhances the performance of applications, especially in scientific and engineering domains.

The primary advantage of parallel programming is its ability to handle large datasets and complex computations efficiently. Techniques such as multithreading, multiprocessing, and using parallel algorithms are common in this field. Multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single program, while multiprocessing utilizes multiple CPUs to execute processes simultaneously. These techniques are essential in modern computing environments where performance and speed are critical.
