Distributed programming enables the development of applications that can scale horizontally by adding more machines to the network. This scalability is achieved through the decomposition of tasks into smaller, independent units that can be executed on different machines. Distributed systems can handle increased load by simply adding more nodes, making them ideal for handling large-scale, resource-intensive applications.

A significant advantage of distributed programming is fault tolerance. Distributed systems can continue functioning even if some nodes fail, as the workload can be redistributed among the remaining nodes. This redundancy is critical for maintaining the availability and reliability of applications, especially in environments where downtime can have severe consequences, such as financial systems or healthcare applications.
